# First Online Portfolio

#### This is my first online portfolio for my first independent project in my Intro to Programming course at Epicodus, 2017

#### By Arianna Chau

## Description

My first portfolio gives the visitor a little bit of information about myself, including hobbies, job experience, interests and past works. It's main purpose is to show people my skills as an aspiring developer. On the top left part of the page you'll find the About section but in the lower half of the site will show other past projects. If you hover over and click on each of the pictures, they will redirect you to my other repositories stored on Github.com.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
